Music library for X2C.
X2C is a tool for the model-based development and code generation of real time control algorithms for microprocessor units (https://x2c.lcm.at)

This project provides blocks for a "Music" library in X2C. The main purpose is to let songs/tunes be played on microprocessor units without the need for manual coding. Songs can be "composed" graphically in Scilab/Xcos by connecting "Note"-blocks in the desired sequence.
Probably, that is not the most efficient way to let music play on microprocessors, but at least the artist does not to have to code.

Thanks for reading and have fun with music!
